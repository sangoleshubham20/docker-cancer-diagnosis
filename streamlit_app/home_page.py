                humans to understand. Our genes are made of DNA which is present in nearly every cell of our bodies.
                Each gene is usually present in two copies, one from each parent. The DNA provides the instructions 
                to make different proteins which are responsible for the various functions in the body. For example, 
                proteins are important for hair and eye color, growth, brain development, movement and metabolism - 
                the conversion of food into energy or body fat and muscle.

                written using a similar genetic alphabet. This process is called transcription. Then, cells read the
                instructions contained in the RNA to make proteins, using a process called translation.
                You can think of RNA as the molecule that carries the message between the DNA and the protein.

                doesn't work properly, or can even prevent a protein from being made at all. Once
                sequenced, a cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. But the challenge is
                distinguishing the mutations that contribute to tumor growth (drivers) from the neutral mutations
                (passengers). Currently this interpretation of genetic mutations is being done manually. This is a
                very time-consuming task where a Geneticist has to manually review and classify every single genetic
                mutation based on evidence from text-based clinical literature.
